# Discord Bot Template

Discord Bot Template is a Github template beneficial in creating a Discord bot using [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/Discord.py).

This template is based on [Tidal Bot](https://github.com/MiningMark48/Tidal-Bot).

## Some things to note
- More info will be coming soon on how to use this template
- This template is still in the works
- This template is also not a solution for everyone, but it works for me as a good starting point
- This is not meant to be a tutorial necessarily, but it can be used as one.
